## 2024-05-18 - BaseCollection O(N) lookup bottleneck
**Learning:** The Electron main process relies on `BaseCollection.getProvider()` for frequent inter-service communication, which previously used an $O(N)$ `.find()` iteration over an array. As the number of registered providers grows, this causes unnecessary performance overhead during IPC message routing and inter-service calls.
**Action:** When working with core registries that handle heavy traffic or frequent lookups (like IPC service resolution), pre-compute an internal `Map` to guarantee $O(1)$ lookups, even if the array is relatively small.

## 2024-03-15 - Prevent unnecessary re-renders in refIpc
**Learning:** In Vue/Electron architectures, bridging IPC state directly to Vue reactive references (like `refIpc` values) can trigger unnecessary component tree re-renders. IPC payloads frequently provide new object references for structurally identical data. Because Vue's `ref` uses strict equality (`===`) by default, updating the ref with a structurally identical but distinct object reference will cause components watching that ref to unnecessarily re-render.
**Action:** Use deep equality checks (e.g., `lodash.isEqual`) when assigning new values from IPC payloads to Vue `ref`s to verify if the content has actually changed before assigning it and triggering reactivity.
